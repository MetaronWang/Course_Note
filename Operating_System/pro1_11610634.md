#   Task1 Efficient Alarm Clock
##  Database Structure and Function
*   Database Structure:
    *   LinkedList: I will use a List to build a list called sleep_list to storage the threads which is blocked.
        ```C
            static struct list sleep_list;
        ```
    *   thread, I need to change the structure $thread$, add a member variable $sleep\_ticks$ to storage how many times this thread need to sleep at the current tick.
        ```C
            struct thread{
                \*The original member variable*\
                int64_t sleep_ticks;
            }
        ```

*   Function:
    *   $timer\_sleep()$: This is a function which is exist in the src/device/timer.c, this function is used to sleep the thread by use function $thread\_yield()$, but it's not a good way to sleep the function in this way and the reason I will mention in the Rationale part. So we need to modify this function to fit my algorithm
    *   $timer\_block$: This is a function which is exist in the src/device/timer.c, this function is used to block a thread, it will choice the current thread and change the $thread\rightarrow status$ to THREAD_BLOCKED
    *   $timer\_block$: This is a function which is exist in the src/device/timer.c, this function is used to block a thread, it will choice the thread incoming and change the $thread\rightarrow status$ to THREAD_READY, then push this $thread\rightarrow elem$to the $ready\_list$.
    *   $thread\_foreach$: This is a function which is exist in the src/thread/thread.c, this function will be transfer in the function $timer_interrupt$, and it will execute a function which is incoming into itself.
