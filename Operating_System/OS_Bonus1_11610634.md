#   Implementation
##  Single Thread Merge Sort 
*   Build a full binary tree by the array that need to  be sorted, each leaf node of the tree is the element in the array.
*   Merge each subTree of this tree from the bottom to the top, each subTree after merge is a ordered sequence.
*   When the two subTree of the root node has been merged, the sort has been finished.

##  Multiple Threads Merge Sort
*   Feasibility: As above, the merge sort will merge the subTree from button to the button, for the feature of the binary tree, we can know each process of merge two subTree can be independence.
*   Implementation: In a node,  when I do the merge sort for each of its subTree, I will create two new threads to do this, and when these two threads finish, I will merge the two sorted sequences of these two subTree and get a new sorted sequences.

##  Analysis:
For the result we get above:
*   When the size of the array need to be sorted is small, the more thread can't improve the speed by a large margin. 
*   When the size of the array is large(more then 10e6), we can find that, multiple threads can run more faster than the single thread. The reason is that multiple threads can run on the different core of the CPU, so for my computer, it can improve speed 4 times when all the core are used in the sort.
*   When I add  the max number of the threads from 5 to 8, we can find the speed can be faster a lot, but when I add the number from 8 to 16, it just can improve a little.
    *   When the max number of thread is 5, for the structure of my program, the highest 2 level nodes will always hold a thread, and the 2 remaining threads will be hold by the nodes on the lower levels. There will be at least 3 thread in parallel.
    *   When the max number of thread is 8, for the structure of my program, the highest 3 level nodes will always hold a thread, and the 1 remaining threads won't be hold by the nodes on the lower levels. There will be at least 4 thread in parallel.
    *   When the max number of thread is 16, for the structure of my program, the highest 4 level nodes will always hold a thread, and the 1 remaining threads won't be hold by the nodes on the lower levels. But for that my computer is 2cores 4 threads, so there also will be at least 4 thread in parallel.
    *   So we can know, when the max number of thread more than 2 times of the thread that the cpu support, the speed won't improve so much.
