#   Design
This Lab is designed base on the Lab1 and Lab2. I add multi-thread part in it on the skeleton, SimpleRegistryServer, and Client.

In the skeleton and SimpleRegistryServer, I create a thread pool to implement the multi-thread. I set the corePoolSize be 4, maximumPoolSize be 20, to decrease the cost of creating and destroying the threads.
```Java
        ThreadPoolExecutor service = new ThreadPoolExecutor(4,20,500, TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS,new LinkedBlockingQueue<>());

```
For the client, I extends Thread class, and use for loop to create thread.
In this class, I use two way to simulate a large number of clients   that concurrently attempt to register an account to the server.
*   The first way is to create the thread and start it immediately.
*   The second way is create so much threads, and start it at same time.

#   Problem
####    1.  The encode algorithm for the password will take so much performance of my laptop which just have a low voltage CPU and make some influence for the test result.
*   Solution:   I skip the step that encode the password.

####    2.  When I test in the first way, if I create more than 30000 threads, the post will be used up.
*   Solution:   Modify the configuration of the network for the system. In the linux, I add some rows in the /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```shell
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 2 
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000
    ```
####    3.  When I test in the second way, I can't create more than 10000 threads at same time even if I have enough memory.
*    Solution:    There may be some problem with JVM, and I haven't solve it.

####    4.  The creating and destroying of the thread cost so much time and the program run slower in the late stage.
*   Solution:   Use thread pool to use thread repeatedly to decrease the times creating and destroying the threads. Limit the current number of the threads.

#   Result
    The test run on my laptop, with $Intel\quad 6200U\quad @4\times 2.8GHz$ and $20GiB$ memory. The OS is ArchLinux.
*   Use the first way:
    *   This way is to test the stability of my RMI in when the server always receive so many request to transfer the service

| The Number of Request | The Number of RMI success | The Number of SQL success | Rate of RMI Success(%) |
| :---------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
|                  8000                  |                     8000                      |                     8000                      |                  100                   |
|                 10000                 |                    10000                     |                     9999                      |                  100                   |
|                 30000                 |                    30000                     |                    30000                     |                  100                   |
|                 50000                 |                    50000                     |                    49998                     |                  100                   |
|                100000                |                   100000                    |                    99990                     |                  100                   |

The Reason that the SQL success number not equal to the RMI success number is that the username is a random number from 0 to 1000000000, so it maybe repeated and can't insert into the database.

*   Use the second way:
    *   This way is to test the performance that the server receive so many request to transfer the service in one time.    
In this way, I will add a piece of code in the front of the run() method:
    ```Java
        try {
            latch.await(); //Block the thread until the latch become 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    ```
This code can let all the thread block here and unblock after all the threads have been created.
